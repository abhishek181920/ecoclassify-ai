EcoClassify AI ‚Äì Waste Classification System
Project Overview
EcoClassify AI is an AI-powered waste classification system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify waste images into six categories: plastic, metal, glass, cardboard, paper, and trash. The system enables real-time waste recognition via webcam or image upload and is deployed as an interactive web/mobile app using Streamlit.

Problem Statement
Objective:
Develop an AI-powered waste classification system using CNNs to classify images of waste into six core categories: plastic, metal, glass, cardboard, paper, and trash. The project aims to simplify waste sorting and promote recycling with a user-friendly mobile/web application for real-time image-based classification.

Features
Instant Waste Classification:
Upload or capture waste images using your device‚Äôs camera and get fast AI-based categorization.

Supported Classes:

üì¶ Cardboard

ü•õ Glass

üîß Metal

üìÑ Paper

ü•§ Plastic

üóëÔ∏è Trash

Real-time Prediction:
Classifies images in real-time using a pre-trained deep learning model (ResNet50V2 by default, EfficientNetV2B1 as alternative).

Detailed Results:

Main predicted class and confidence score

Bar chart of confidence scores for all categories

Personalized recycling tips for the detected class

Environmental impact suggestions

Intuitive UI:

Clean Streamlit interface with custom CSS

Interactive sidebar with app information, user instructions, model stats, and confidence threshold slider

Technical Highlights
Deep Learning Model:
ResNet50V2 (or EfficientNetV2B1) trained via TensorFlow/Keras.
Model optimizations include data augmentation, label smoothing, and Mixed Precision (FP16) GPU support for high speed and efficiency.

Data Preprocessing:

Automated resizing, color normalization, and augmentation for each upload

MixUp regularization for robust generalization

Real-Time Deployment:
Streamlit app (app.py) lets users upload or capture photos, view classification results, and access recycling guidance‚Äîall directly in the browser.
